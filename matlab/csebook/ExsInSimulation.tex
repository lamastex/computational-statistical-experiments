\begin{ExerciseList}
\Exercise Suppose the continuous RV $X$ has PDF:
\[
f_X(x) = \left(\pi(1+x^2) \right)^{-1}
\]
Devise an algorithm to transform samples from $\uniform(0,1)$ RV to those from $X$. Present your answer as pseudo-code.
\Answer
This is nothing but the inversion sampler for the standard Cauchy RV $X$.
