Abstract:
This paper discusses the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) 
to illustrate sampling from a trinomial distribution by the natural extension 
of Galton's Quincunx to three dimensions.

Keywords:
Multinomial distribution, GUI, vector addition, 
Galton's binomial Quincunx and the trinomial Septcunx.

How to run the GUI:
The additional files that are needed for the GUI are included in this 
directory.  The Matlab M-files need to be in the current working directory.  
Then simply call guiMultinomial from the Matlab Command Window.

Contents of the directory:
AddOutcomes.m           PdfMultOutcomes.m       createDeMoivreSampler.m
MultinomialOutcomes.m   README.txt              guiMultinomial.fig
MultinomialPdf.m        createData.m            guiMultinomial.m

Number of lines of code:
      42 AddOutcomes.m
      17 MultinomialOutcomes.m
       8 MultinomialPdf.m
      15 PdfMultOutcomes.m
